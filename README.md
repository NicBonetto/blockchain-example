# blockchain-example
A blockchain example using Python 3.

# Getting Started
This application uses Python 3 and pip, so ensure they are installed. Follow these command lines in your terminal:

```
$ git clone 
$ cd blockchain-example/
$ python3 server.py
```
Important Note: pip install flask will only install to Python 2. To use flask with Python 3, create a new virtual environment with virtualenv and Python 3 and install flask in the virtual environment. Otherwise, you will run into an error where the flask module cannot be found.
